# Exploring the Digital Mind.
**A Hacker's Guide to the Future.**

DigitalReplica explores the concept of a digital mind, hacking together pieces using existing technologies.

It is a text based approach. Like NetHack, or an emacs-based web browser, but modernized with APIs and cloud storage and compute.

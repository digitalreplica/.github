# Exploring Digital Thought
**A Hacker's Guide to the Future**

DigitalReplica explores digital thought, hacking together existing technologies like git, markdown, and web UIs. It is a text based approach, like NetHack or an emacs web browser, but modernized with APIs and cloud storage and compute.

I'm [Danny Rappleyea](https://github.com/dannyrappleyea), owner and lonely human of the DigitalReplica single-member LLC.

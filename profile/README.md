# Exploring Digital Thought
**A Hacker's Guide to the Future**

DigitalReplica explores digital thought, hacking together existing technologies like git, markdown, and web UIs.

It is a text based approach, like NetHack or an emacs web browser, but modernized with APIs and cloud storage and compute.
